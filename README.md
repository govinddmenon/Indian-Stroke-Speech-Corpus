Indian Stroke Speech Corpus
==================================================================
Indian stroke speech corpus consists of  speech  recorded  from  50  stroke patients  and  50  healthy  controls. 
These  recordings are  carried out in Indian hospital  environments. The  development of the  speech  corpus  has  been  carried out in collaboration wit h all india institute of  medical  science (AIIMS) Managalagiri
The  details  of the  corpus  is  avaialble  in the published  paper titled "Analysis and development of clinically recorded dysarthric speech corpus for patients affected with various stroke conditions"
The  corpus  consists of  three tyes of  utterances: 5 Vowels, 3 words and  10  sentences (in Telugu). Due  to  the  severity  of  stroke,  some patients could not  utterred all sentences.    




Researchers interested in dysarthric speech classification are encouraged to utilize the corpus for academic research purposes.

-->Currently, the shared corpus is limited to use for classification between dysarthric speech and healthy controls. The labels indicating stroke severity, based on the NIHSS scale, will be released in due course.
---> The  preliminary, dysarthric  speech classsification results are  reported  in  our  published  paper
